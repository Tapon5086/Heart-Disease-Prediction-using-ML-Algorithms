# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using ML Algorithms

This project explores the use of **machine learning algorithms** to predict the presence of **heart disease** based on clinical data. It includes data preprocessing, correlation-based feature selection, model training, evaluation, and a deployed prediction interface using Streamlit.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ Correlation-based feature selection
- ✅ Multiple classifiers: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, Naive Bayes
- ✅ Performance comparison on balanced vs. unbalanced data
- ✅ Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ✅ Streamlit app for real-time prediction
- ✅ Serialized models (`.pkl`) for fast loading and reuse

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest

Each model was trained on both raw and balanced datasets, using SMOTE for oversampling where needed.

## 🚀 How to Run the App

### 1. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn streamlit matplotlib seaborn
````

### 2. Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your default browser. Input patient parameters and get the prediction instantly.

## 🔍 Dataset Overview

* The dataset contains **clinical attributes** like age, cholesterol, resting BP, chest pain type, etc.
* Target: Presence of heart disease (binary classification)

## 📊 Model Performance

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| Logistic Regression | 86.5%    | 0.89      | 0.85   | 0.87     |
| KNN                 | 83.7%    | 0.84      | 0.82   | 0.83     |
| Random Forest       | 88.2%    | 0.91      | 0.86   | 0.88     |
| Naive Bayes         | 80.4%    | 0.79      | 0.81   | 0.80     |

*(Note: Metrics may vary depending on preprocessing and seed)*

## 🧪 Testing

You can test predictions in the Streamlit app using sample inputs.

To test programmatically:

```python
import joblib
model = joblib.load("cad.pkl")
sample = [[63, 1, 3, 145, 233, 1, 0, 150, 0, 2.3, 0, 0, 1]]  # Example input
prediction = model.predict(sample)
```
